# Recognition CNN model for distinguishing cat and dog pictures.
The training and test picture dataset is so large that it cannot be uploaded into Github Repository. 
However, I provide the folder structure below for your reference:

├── pytorch_GPU_CNN_dog_cat.ipynb (it's the only one which has been uploaded to my github repository.)
└── dog_vs_cat_model.pth
